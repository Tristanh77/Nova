# Nova

Nova is a photo based social medial app that incorporates a space theme. Users can sign up using a profile picture and a custom bio and share posts using nasa's image database. Add your own caption for each photo. Other users can then see and like your posts. Click on the profile picture of the user's post to go to their profile page and check out what they have been up to.
